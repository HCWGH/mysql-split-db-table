# wavelets
Hobby code related to Digital Signal Processing.

###Functionality
Current functionality is:

1. 1-D Fast Fourier transform and inverse
2. 1-D Discrete wavelet transform and inverse
3. Convolution
4. Cross correlation
5. Auto correlation
6. Generating a QMF pair


Utility functions include 

1. Calculating L2 norm
2. Upsampling
3. Array operations like padding, element wise operations
4. Plotting a 1-D signal with the help of JFreeChart

###Dependencies
1. Java 8
2. Apache commons math (Complex)
3. JFreeChart (for plotting utils only)
4. Guava
